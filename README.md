# ECG-Heart-Beats-Detection-
This notebook is designed for a heartbeat classification project, using machine learning and deep learning techniques to process and analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The data is sourced from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, commonly used for detecting and classifying cardiac arrhythmias.

# Objective
The notebook focuses on:

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
To understand the distribution and characteristics of heartbeat classes.

# Preprocessing: 
Preparing the data for model training, such as label encoding and feature scaling.

# Deep Learning Models:
State files for attention, LSTM, and CNN models are referenced, suggesting their use for training/testing the ECG data.

# Potential Applications
Detecting abnormalities in heartbeat rhythms.
Training deep learning models for multi-class classification of heartbeat types.
Comparing performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) of different models.
